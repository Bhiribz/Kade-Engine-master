The chromatic scale is the voice that was used in Freaky. The voice samples that were used in Era and BPM were clips of me saying vowels pitched in NewTone.
Unfortunately, the original samples were deleted, so I had to take some of the samples and pitch them to a C. So they're not the original samples, but they'll do.
But besides that, I hope that these are still able to help you make mashups, rips, etc! Thank you for playing my mod!
